Random Forest is similar to Bagging using multiple model versions and aggregating the ensemble of models to make a single prediction. RF uses an ensemble of tree’s and introduces randomness into each tree by randomly selecting a subset of the features for each node to split on. This makes the predictions of each tree uncorrelated, improving results when the models are aggregated. In this lab, we will illustrate the sampling process of RF to Bagging, then demonstrate how each predictor for random forest are not correlated. Finally, we will apply Random Forests to several datasets using Grid-Search to find the optimum  Hyperparameters.\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e0e7e198-e332-493e-97f6-1cbeea7b13f3","metadata":{},"source":["<h1>Table of contents</h1>\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n","    <ol>\n","        <li><a href=\"https://#RFvsBag\">What's the difference between RF and Bagging </a></li>\n","        <li><a href=\"https://#Example\">Cancer Data Example</li>\n","        <li><a href=\"https://practice/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML241ENSkillsNetwork31576874-2022-01-01\">Practice</a></li>\n","\n","</div>\n","<br>\n","<hr>\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"05404151-a679-4cab-b7ab-fbac3be2a8d8","metadata":{},"source":["Let's first import the required libraries:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"639a3251-4e5c-4642-b4f3-31a4d6d97828","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# All Libraries required for this lab are listed below.
