如何发现数据中的异常值
histogram, density plot, box plot

interquatile range, stadard deviation 

q25, q50, q75 = np.percnetile(data, [25,50,75])
iqr = q75 - q25
min = q25 - 1.5*iqr
max = q55 + 1.5*iqr

any data outside the (min, max) is a outlier

residuals: standardizde, deleted, studentized 


policise for outliers

remove them
assign the mean or median value
transform the variable
predict the value by 1. similar observations 2. regression method 
keep them 

--------------EDA-----------

techniques:

statistics: average, median, min, max, correlations

visualizations: histograms, scatter plots, box plots




plt.plot(x,y,ls='',marker='o') # ls stands for line style, set to "" means no line just the marker.
plt.plot(x,y,ls='',marker='o') # ls stands for line style, set to "" means no line just the marker.
plt.plot(x,y,ls='',marker='o') # ls stands for line style, set to "" means no line just the marker.

if we call plt.plot many times without call plt.show then all the figure will crate in the same figure.


plt.hist(data, bins=20) # n data of each box 


fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.set_xlabel("a") # this only changes the xlabel  
ax.set(xlabel="a", ylabel="y",...) # change x and y at the same time  

make a plot after groupby and aggfunc

data.groupby(by=["frature"]).mean().plot(color=[]) 
# and pandas will handel the x and y auto? the group is deminsion thus it will be x-axis



sns.pairplot 

sns.joinplot(x,y, kind="hex")  # show the distribution

sns.FacetGrid  # 这是啥？？





Which residual-based approach to identifying outliers compares running a model with all data to running the same model, but dropping a single observation? 
Standardized residuals
Unstandardized residuals
Externally-studentized residuals
Abnormally-studentized residuals 


-------------- transform data ---------------
 
prediction from linear regression model assume residuals are normally distributed.
but feature and predicted data ofen skewed, thus we introduced data transformation 




------------ parametric vs non-parametric 
parametric model is a particular type of statistical model with finite number of parameters.
e.g. normal distribution it depend on the mean and var 

non-parametric statistics we don't assume that the data belong to any particular distribution.

common way of estimating parameters is a parametric model is maximum likehood estimation (MLE)

commonly use distribution:
1. uniform distribution
